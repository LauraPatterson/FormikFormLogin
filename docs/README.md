# Formik Form - Login
First attempt using Fromik to create basic login

## Description
A simple login form with username, password, and submit

### My Contribution (/src/app.js)
- Created a form with divs and input fields
- Imported useFormik from Formik Library
- Built useFormik() and added necessary attributes to input fields for Formik implementation
- Added validation code to check that fields aren't empty and that username is in email format

## How to Run
Not currently possible. There is a giant folder of node_modules that I would need to upload.

If I did upload them, the directions would be:
1. Download all files
2. Open terminal
3. enter npm install formik --save
4. cd to folder with all the files
5. enter npm install
6. enter npm start

This should bring up your default browser with the form.
